      What platforms will IGO offer? Currently IGO is offering all of our normal platforms except for Nanostring. How do I submit samples?
      Our guidelines for sample submission during Phase III re-opening can be found here. Plates for samples can be picked up outside ZRC320

      Sadly, until we are operating at 100% capacity, we will not be able to rush your project. Everything will be processed on a
