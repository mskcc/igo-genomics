    body: `<p align="left">
    Anthony “Tony” DeBlasio, a respected senior researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, whose encyclopedic knowledge and intellectual curiosity inspired and amazed his colleagues and friends, died unexpectedly on July 16. He was 65.<br />
    <br />
    “Every single day was a discovery to him,” said Andrea Farina, DeBlasio’s supervisor in the IGO lab. “His knowledge was impressive and always connected with other elements. I discovered on a daily basis how much he knew and how enthusiastic he was about so many topics.”<br />
    <br />
    Farina said he admired DeBlasio’s vast scientific knowledge, and how he could take what could have been a dry subject and interweave it with theories that turned it into a fascinating discussion.<br />
    <br />
    “Tony had an open mind and was always willing to try new things,” he said. “I would always leave his desk feeling better than I was before.”
    Agnes Viale, the director of Core Facilities at MSK, who hired Tony in 2013 in her then-role as IGO lab director, called him “a gentle soul who was so very smart.”<br />
    <br />
    “Tony was passionate about everything he did,” Viale said. “His mind was always working a mile a minute, and you could always count on Tony – there was nothing fake about him at all.”<br />
    <br />
    In his role in the IGO lab as a senior research assistant, DeBlasio specialized in RNA and DNA extraction. He had a special interest in working to help children and was particularly excited every Monday when the pediatric patient samples arrived at the lab for whole genome and RNA sequencing. “He was always so concerned about how he could work on the samples,” Farina said. “He wanted to make sure that the children were taken care of.”<br />
    <br />
    Cassidy Cobbs, a senior project manager who worked in the lab with DeBlasio, said he “enjoyed and was good at the physical work of making science happen.”
    “Tony was the first line of the process (in working with pediatric patient samples),” Cobbs said. “He did the extraction no matter what the sample type – blood, bone marrow, tissue, fingernails, or buccal swabs.”<br />
    <br />
    His colleagues say that DeBlasio’s death has left an irreplaceable void in the IGO lab and MSK as an organization.<br />
    <br />
    “We have lost a major point of reference in the lab,” Farina said.<br />
    <br />
    DeBlasio was preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by his loving wife, Eun Hee Choi, his older brother, Dan, and his stepson, Sam Seok Jun Hwang.<br />

    As sequencing-heavy applications such as Whole Genome Sequencing and 10X Genomics Single Cell Sequencing continue to grow and usage of the Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing platform increases, storage space is an ongoing challenge for IGO. To accommodate newer platforms and in anticipation of the arrival of the NovaSeqX sequencing instrument later this year, we are tweaking our policies to ensure we have sufficient space.<br />

However, there will be both a delay and a charge to recover archived files.<br />
    <br />
    FAST5 files will only be kept for <b>30 days</b> after delivery (previously 6 months) and will not be recoverable after that point.<br />

    Previous policies remain in place: BAM files for RNA-Seq will be linked for <b>6 months</b> and Cell Ranger, Space Ranger, Tapestri, and CRISPResso pipeline results will be available for <b>3 months</b>. After that time, they can be regenerated from FASTQ files for a fee.

      In support of our ongoing efforts to provide excellent customer service alongside our cutting-edge technologies, IGO's
      Data Team has worked to upgrade our genomics.mskcc.org site. Executed in just over a month, the new site provides easier
      access to tools and information while increasing functionality. Please feel free to contact us at genomics@mskcc.org if
      you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for the website.

      IGO’s Data Team is pleased to roll out a new
      <a href="https://igo.mskcc.org/login/request-tracker"> request tracking application</a>. Use this tool for real-time
      visualization of IGO’s progress on your project, with detail to the sample level. Try it out in the IGO Marketplace today!
    </p>
    <p>
      As demand for single cell sequencing rises, IGO continues to invest in platforms to cover a wide variety of sample types
      and data needs. See which application is right for your sample set
      <a href="https://genomics.mskcc.org/single-cell-hub">here</a>.

    <p>
      Currently, IGO’s data delivery consists of FASTQ files separated by sample, sequencer run, and read (forward vs reverse).
      <strong>Starting January 2021, there will be an additional layer of separation: by sequencer lane. </strong>
