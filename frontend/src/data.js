      "For investigators who make their own sequencing libraries to submit to IGO, we now have easy-to-understand block pricing for our most commonly-requested read lengths and throughputs. We accept both individual user libraries and pre-pooled libraries to occupy a full flow cell or lane. Custom read lengths and coverages outside the block pricing will still be accepted; contact us for more information.",

While the core jumped at the opportunity to support our colleagues and city through the ongoing pandemic, we also look forward to turning our full attention back to our mission of supporting and enabling a broad range of research efforts at MSK. We will continue to provide COVID-19 testing of research samples. In addition to the new 10X Genomics Visium platform, we are improving our website resources for investigators. A searchable, comprehensive list of our ddPCR assays is now available and stay tuned for a project tracker, currently in beta testing!",
